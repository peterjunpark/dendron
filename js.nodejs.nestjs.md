NestJS is an out-of-the-box architecture meant to be used as an abstraction on top of something like [[js.express]] and Fastify. At its core, NestJS leverages the capabilities of [[js.express]] for handling HTTP requests and managing routing, but adds layers of organization and strucutre.

It provides an opinionated architectural approach and various tools that simplify the process of building complex applications. It uses decorators, modules, providers, and other abstractions to help you organize and scale your codebase more efffectively.
