`IndexedDB` is a robust web API that offers a powerful solution for storing and retrieving structured data within web browsers. This API serves as a [[db.nosql]] database designed specifically for web applications, enabling them to locally store data. It's particularly well-suited for scenarios where offline functionality, data caching, or storing user-generated content is required.
