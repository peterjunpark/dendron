`manifest.json` is a JSON file that encapsulates essential metadata about your PWA. It provides crucial information to the browser, allowing it to understand the app's identity, appearance, and behavior. By including this file in your web app's root directory and properly configuring it, you pave the way for a seamless, app-like experience for your users.

## Key elements

1. Name and Short Name: These are the names of your PWA, displayed to users when they interact with your app. The short name is often used when space is limited, making it a concise and recognizable representation of your app.

2. Description: A brief description that gives users an idea of what your app offers and its purpose.

3. Icons: A variety of icons in different sizes to represent your app on various devices and contexts. These icons contribute to the app's visual identity.

4. Start URL: The URL at which your PWA should start when launched. It ensures a consistent entry point for users, resembling the behavior of native apps.

5. Display Type: This determines how your app is displayed to users. It could be fullscreen, standalone, or in a browser tab.

6. Theme Color: The color that defines your app's theme and is reflected in the browser UI when the app is launched.

7. Background Color: This color is displayed before your app fully loads, creating a smooth transition from launching the app to its content.
